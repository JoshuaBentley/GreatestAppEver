## All in one life style app 

let me explain how this app works!
1. our home page really is just a welcome page let you know how this app works and to say hello.
2. our workout page will give you tips for weight training and you can search for exercises by any muscle you would like!!
3. our recipe page will give great meals to cook just type in the name of the dish you would like a nd BOOM! recipe and ingredients to make that dish
4. our calculator page will give you the BMR based of your weight and height and give you your TDEE based of the information you feed into the BMR counter
5. progress page will log anything you put in it!  

challanges face durring this project:
1. finding the right api was hard
2. trying to use that API in the proper way took me a few times to figure out
